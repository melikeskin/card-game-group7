Our project will be a card game. The user can make his/her own deck from a
variety of cards. There will be some special class cards(for example mage
as a special class) that cannot be chosen for other classes ( for example,
warrior cards). The decks will consist of 30 cards, players can only
choose 2 of the same cards in their decks. In the game 1st player will
start with 3 cards, and the second player will get 4 cards, there will be
a resource called mana, it will replenish and increase by 1 at the start
of each turn. The mana will be used for playing the cards in their hand
and each card will specify their mana cost. There will be various types of
cards such as minion cards, the goal of the game is to kill the oponent,
by reducing their total life points to 0, and every player will start with
30 life points.
